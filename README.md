# ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain + Next.js Starter Template

This template scaffolds a simple LangChain.js + Next.js starter template. It has one endpoint, `POST /api/chat`, that streams back a model call to
the frontend. It uses Vercel's [AI SDK](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai) to pipe the stream back to the client as well as display the incoming messages.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result! Ask the bot something and you'll see a streamed response:

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

Backend logic lives in `app/api/chat/route.ts`. From here, you can change the prompt and model, or add other modules and logic.
